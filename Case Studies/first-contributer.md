# 🧑‍💻 Case Study: How I Earned My First $100 From Building a Discord ModMail Bot

**The Beginning**  

I’ve always been passionate about building tools that solve problems, and being active in a few Discord communities made me realize just how frustrating it could be for server owners and mods to manage private conversations with users. That’s when the idea for a **ModMail bot** was born.  

The goal was simple: create a bot that allows users to send private messages to server staff through a public channel, without spamming DMs or cluttering the server. It would allow moderators to reply and track issues efficiently. It would be a game changer for community-driven servers.

I started building the bot with **Discord.js**, focused on features like automated ticket creation, logging, and staff-only access for replies. The initial version was pretty basic — no flashy features, just a simple “create ticket, send messages, close ticket” flow.

**The Early Struggles**  

At first, things didn’t go as smoothly as I had hoped. I faced challenges, especially with the bot’s response time in large servers. Every update seemed to bring new bugs, and I had to spend hours debugging and testing.

Even worse, no one seemed to notice my project. I posted it to Discord bot lists, shared it in a few Discord communities, and tried to reach out to content creators. But no one was biting. It felt like my bot was floating in a sea of other bots, many of them far more polished than mine. I almost gave up.

But then, I realized that I wasn’t putting myself **out there enough**. I needed to engage the community and **build in public**. So, I started sharing my progress more consistently on Twitter and Reddit, and I began documenting my journey: the lessons learned, the challenges faced, and the improvements I was making to the bot.

**The Turning Point: Community Engagement & Support**  

A few weeks later, a large server owner reached out to me. They had tried the ModMail bot and were experiencing some issues related to server-specific needs. They offered to **donate $50** if I helped them with some customizations and performance optimizations.

This was my first taste of **earning from open source**, and it gave me the motivation to push forward. I worked with the server owner, solved their problems, and improved the bot in the process. They were so satisfied with the result that they not only donated, but also recommended my bot to several other server owners.

With that validation, I felt more confident. I started adding new features based on community feedback, such as:

- Customizable auto-responses for staff
- Advanced ticket categories for different types of issues
- A role-based permissions system for better control over who could access tickets
- Logging and notifications for both staff and users

Soon after, I added a **"Sponsor"** button to the project page, as well as a **Buy Me a Coffee** link. While I didn’t expect it to be much, I was surprised when a handful of users started contributing small donations. A few weeks later, another server owner offered me $50 for **custom development work** — this time, to integrate the bot with their custom moderation tools.

**The Breakthrough: Earning From Open Source**  

In total, I ended up earning **$100** from the ModMail bot in the first few months — not through a big company sponsorship or a viral tweet, but through genuine community engagement. I had helped solve real problems for people, and they were willing to show their appreciation.

The key lesson I learned was that open source isn’t just about code. It’s about **building relationships**, solving real problems, and making sure people know you exist. Once I focused on offering real value and **asked for support**, things started to happen.

**What’s Next?**  

Since then, the bot has grown in popularity. I’ve continued to improve it, adding new features, and the donations have kept coming. I’m also planning to start offering **premium services**, such as custom integrations, priority support, and exclusive features for paying users.

What started as a simple project has now turned into something sustainable, all because I built in public, solved real problems, and didn’t shy away from asking for help when I needed it.

> **Moral of the story:** Earning from open source is entirely possible, even as a solo developer. But success doesn’t come overnight — it’s a mix of **consistent effort, community engagement**, and a willingness to **ask for support**. If you can solve a problem that people care about, the rewards will follow.
